    I am Manoj Abusaria, Joint director (Ministry of earth sciences, Prithvi bhavan)
    I came to know about NEET Advisor through their NEET Webinar
    The way they had given information on SMART COUNSELLING, I CAME TO KNOW WHAT NEET COUNSELLING IS ?<br>
    Today my daughter is studying in Symbiosis women medical college pune, because of the services provided by the team of NEET Advisor.  Earlier we got admission into adesh medical college but from the first day itself, I wanted her to study in far better college in my fees budget. THEN AT THAT POINT NEET ADVISOR SUGGESTED me TO TAKE THE RISK OF LEAVING that college and go for a better one. I followed them and they proved to be true on the day of 14th jan when my daughter got admitted into symbiosis women’s medical college.<br>
    I realised that NEET ADVISOR Does NOT BELIEVE IN manipulation. They do accurate calculations on the basis of scientific approach. My blessings are always with the team of NEET Advisor.

    Friends, I am Babu Rao. I came to know about NEET advisor through someone and I visited their office and I  discussed about my daughter’s admission in to MBBS and they guided me like anything and ultimately I came out with flying colours, as my daughter got a seat in Sri Rama medical college, Kanpur. I am very happy because I never expected that my daughter would be through, because she got lesser marks, I mean I have no hesitation to say that.<br>
    The way NEET ADVISOR showed me the path and the way they guided me that really made the difference, otherwise I would have been  left with nothing and my daughter was ready to drop this year and prepare for next year, so I really thank NEET ADVISOR TEAM for their sincere efforts.

    I want to share that “ there are different types of people/ professionals in the city“ but a truly professional, not only professional in the professional sense but as a good human beings, we have come to know some very nice, fine person like Mr. Bansal and Vivek Ji who have been very helpful throughout the NEET Counselling and have given us time which is most important.<br>
    We got best possible advise from neet advisor which has GIVEN US A GREAT assurance, apart from the fact that the child has done well but “fine tuning and making good choices at the right time” , is very important, in which they all have helped.<br>
    We are grateful to the entire team of NEET ADVISOR.  All the very best
