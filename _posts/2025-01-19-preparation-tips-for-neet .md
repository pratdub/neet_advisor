### TIP 1:
**Understanding the syllabus, and exam pattern**
- Syllabus of NEET UG includes 200 questions which is required to be completed in the duration of 3 hours 20 min.
- Each subject will consist of two sections. Section A will consist of 35 Questions and Section B will have 15 Questions, out of these 15 Questions, candidates can choose to attempt any 10 Questions. So, the total number of questions and utilization of time will remain the same.
  - For Section A (MCQs): To answer a question, the candidates need to choose one option corresponding to the correct answer or the most appropriate answer.
  - For Section B (MCQs): Candidates need to attempt any 10 Questions out of 15 Questions given. In the event of a candidate has attempted more than 10 questions, only the first 10 attempted questions will be considered for evaluation.
- 4 marks are awarded for every correct answer and 1 mark is deducted for wrong answers.
- Set a target score of at least 650. After getting through with the exam pattern, start understanding the syllabus.

### TIP 2:
**Start studying** Making a plan is easy but its execution is what requires strength. Know your most effective hours and start your NEET 2025 preparation in those hours. In order to prepare for NEET 2025, it is important to study for at least 12 hours per day. Having a 650+ in your NEET 2025 requires you to devote 50 percent of your time in a day to study.

**Practice questions** 
- Practice as many questions as possible for all three subjects. This will help you understand the type of questions asked from each topic and you will know how far you stand from your target score.
