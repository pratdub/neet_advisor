#### Causes of stress

"Students are one of the most common victims of stress."

- Factors such as financial expenses, overcommitment, family expectations, deadlines and improper time management all induces stress in students.
- While a mild amount of stress is very useful and acts as a motivation for students, too much stress can interfere with their daily lives.

- Managing stress in its early stages can help maximize the college/university experience and opportunities for students.

#### How to cope with exam stress???
1.	**Remember to breathe**
    
    Setting aside a couple of minutes every day to practice mindfulness techniques, such as breathing exercises, helps you to calm down your body's stress response and shift your attention back to the present moment.

2. **Eat, sleep and exercise well**

    - Pulling all-nighters, surviving on a poor diet, and getting minimal amounts of movement in an increases symptom of anxiety. 
    - So, for your body's best performance, make sure you're getting 8/9 hours of sleep, less caffeine and more water, and at least half an hour of exercise per day.
3. **Set realistic goals**

    Setting realistic goals, whether you have several weeks, days or hours before your exam, helps you to put everything into perspective. 
4. **Don't go it alone**

    In 2004, a research paper published in Linguistics and Education saw that revising with peers is an effective study technique as it allows individuals to better absorb their own notes. 
5. **Pace yourself through panic**

    Panicking before, during or even after an exam is common among university students. If you experience it at any point, take six deep breaths, hydrate yourself, and then go back the problem at hand, being sure to break it down into several, manageable chunks. 
6. **Believe in yourself and stay positive**

    - When being constantly faced with new challenges, we often forget to look back at how far we have come and how much we have already achieved. Given that you have prepared well, there should be no reason for you to worry. Therefore, when experiencing a negative thought, try to replace it with a positive one.
    - If you keep focusing on the negative aspects of a situation, you will be burdened by mental stress (Thompson & Gaudreau, 2008). 
    - Instead, try to look at the glass half full, and stay optimistic through tough times.

7.	**Manage time** 

    - Proper time management is one of the most effective stress-relieving techniques (Macan 1990). 
    - Whether it’s relaxation, work or study, time must be spent wisely. 
    - Students must be able to design and stick to a timetable. 


8.	**Stop procrastinating**

    - The best way to stop procrastinating is to get the most difficult tasks out of the way first. 
    - Most people procrastinate because they dread the task they’re putting off. Get rid of the dreaded deed, and you’re good to go.

9.	**Spend time with friends**

    - A cup of coffee with family or friends is all you need to bring your stress levels back to normal.
    - Stress can also get worse if a person feels lonely. By letting out all your thoughts to someone you trust, you immediately feel a lot better.

10.	**Do something you love**

    - If you feel extremely stressed out, take a break and do something you love. 
    - Whether it is painting or listening to music, doing something you enjoy can cheer up your mood and distract you from a stressor.
