How tough is it to prepare for an exam? How long does it take to make it through? Is it a single step procedure? Or does it have multiple layers? With increasing competition, the chances of making it through NEET in itself is quite tough.

It is not just about hard work and burning overnight oil now. The admission procedure requires you to put forward your smartest step. NEET is a benchmark when it is about competitive exams. But it does not end at just only appearing for the exam, qualifying it and getting a fairly decent score! It has lot more.

## Are you working as efficiently as your child?

Parents play a vital role in the admission procedure. It is not only about supporting the child, providing funds for their education or motivating them. It is about gathering all the information that your child will need after appearing for the exam. Let them prepare for the exam.

You, prepare for what comes after it, ‘The NEET Counselling Procedure’. A plethora of coaching institutes are available to help your children with their studies. But we haven't bailed out on you to handle the non-academic process yourself. NEET ADVISOR will educate and assist you through the NEET counselling procedure at the drop of a hat.

## What should a parent do to ensure their child's admission?

• A detailed health analysis of medical colleges is what every parent should do. This includes cut-offs, connectivity, facilities, infrastructure, faculty, etc.

• You should be aware of the detailed structure of counselling, AIQ, State or deemed. You should be aware of the domicile requirements, reservation category, language, quota, etc. To get any kind of leverage that you can possibly get.

• Prepare early and look beyond. Predict a NEET score. And plan every step of your NEET counselling beforehand.

• Keep the documents handy. Do not wait until the last moment.

• Be well versed in the NEET counselling process. Research and educate yourself.

## Do you doubt an effective contribution and involvement from your end?

If you doubt your efficiency and effectiveness in terms of involvement. You're not alone. With hectic schedules, it is almost impossible for every parent to sufficiently contribute to the cause.

In a colossal country like India, it is not easy to research about each and every college. In many cases, it is also necessary to visit the colleges to get a better understanding. But the amount of time and finances that you will have to put in to get a better understanding of the colleges is downright insane.

And that is where organization like NEET ADVISOR comes into play. With the latest data, health analysis of medical college, and every other vital information that you will need for your child's admission, we will guide you through the entire procedure with professional advice.
